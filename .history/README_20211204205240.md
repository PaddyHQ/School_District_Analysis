# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to look analyze the reading and math scores for a district and the fourteen individual schools within it. Schools were ranked based on "overall passing percentage" (OPP), a calculation of the number of students that had an average score of 70% or better for both math and reading divided by the total student population. Schools were then grouped by three different categories: (1) amount of money spent per student on average, (2) school size, (3) type of school. Each category was then compared by OPP.

Initial comparative analysis showed:

1. Charter schools had a higher OPP in this district.
2. Small and medium schools had a higher OPP than large schools.
3. There is an inverse relationship between money spent per student and OPP for this district.

Following this analysis it was revealed that Thomas High School's (THS) 9th grade was involved in academic dishonesty. In response, the dataset was modified to change all THS 9th grader's scores to NaN. The previous analyses were re-run using only the values for 10th-12th grade at THS.

## Results after Thomas High School Adjustments

In Figure 1 above, the highlighted value for THS 9th graders was replaced with "NaN", then all further calculations were done only using the values for 10th-12th grade for THS. Since the 9th graders at THS performed similarly to the other grades at THS, ignoring 9th grade's average scores does not substantially change their passing percentages. If the "NaN" result is included in the data set, all of 9th grade for THS is de facto labeled as a "fail". This would strongly affect

### How is the school summary affected?

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### Math and reading scores by grade

### Scores by school spending

### Scores by school size

### Scores by school type
